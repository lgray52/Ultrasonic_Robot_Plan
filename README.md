## Planning

This robot adresses social distancing measures with COVID-19. The preliminary idea is that is makes noise when someone comes within 2 metres of it to warn them of the proximity. Plus, a couple fun extras ;). 

### Schedule
*Basic timeline:*

Design:
* Preliminary design (like sketches and such): one week (Jan 22)
* Code (Lucy): four weeks (March 15)
* OnShape (Josie): four weeks (March 15)

Meet dates:
* In person: Tuesday
* Via zoom: BKT

Assembly: 
* Wiring: one week (Mar 5)
* Assembly of actual thing: four weeks (Mar 19)

### Changes to basic plan/decisions
* Use a LiDAR sensor for distance sensor
* MP3/audio player of some kind for sound effects
* Box should have a handle
* Disco balls for disco mode
* *Anything I missed?*

## Reflection

### Week of 2/22 - 2/28

For the Onshape, we managed to create a handle, as well as add holes for the arduino. This process showed me how to better construct objects made out of multiple cylinders, as well as how to add screw holes of the right size and placement more easily. For the coding, we were able to choose the sensor that we will be using, which allowed us to begin to work on coding the senser. We met all the goals that we set for ourselves this week, and we are on track to finish the project by the scheduled date! :D
